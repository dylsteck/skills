Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools for building on [Base]. Think of them as "onboarding guides" that transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized assistant equipped with procedural knowledge for Base development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the specific skill directory you want to use
3. Follow the instructions in each skill's markdown file

### Using with Claude

Skills are designed to be loaded into Claude's context when working on relevant tasks. The skill's frontmatter metadata helps Claude understand when to apply specific knowledge:

```yaml

description: Integrates Base Account SDK for authentication and payments...
---
```

## Creating New Skills

This repository includes a skill-creator tool in `.claude/skills/skill-creator/` that provides guidance for creating effective skills. Run the initialization script to bootstrap a new skill:

```bash
python .claude/skills/skill-creator/scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>
```

## Requirements

- Node.js (v16 or higher) for JavaScript/TypeScript skills
- Python 3.8+ for Python scripts
